# Generic RPG

This is a generic character sheet that can be used for story telling, one-shots, custom systems or anything else You can imagine.

Just print [Generic RPG character sheet](https://autioch.github.io/generic-rpg/). You can also just copy the contents to any other document and reformat it to Your liking.

If You have basic knowlegdge of the programming (JSON), feel free to edit the items configuration.

Besides character sheet, there are other resources that I've been collecting over time. See the `resources` folder for the stuff.
